# Important notice

May 11th 2017 - This "demo" may not be updated anymore. I translated it to [Escoria framework](https://github.com/godotengine/escoria) which already has most required features for Point & Click games. You can find it in my repo [escoria-test](https://github.com/StraToN/escoria-test).

# godot_pointandclickadv
Basic Point and Click adventure game demo with Godot

I don't intend to make a full game from this, but it could be a good starting point if I (or anyone) wants to.

This demo project will be complete when it features:
- Objects interactions
- NPC dialog systems
- Room changing
- Inventory & objects combinations
